## Nightmare Fuel
### Objective
The task was to find the flag from the provided video.
### Process
The video was only 10 seconds long, so my initial thought was to split the video up into its frames to see if the flag was written on one of them.
Luckily, before I looked through the 105 frames, I opened up the video's metadata in Notepad and found the flag at the end of the metadata.
### Flag
The correct flag was: `fh453n3fk45b384gm$&%#fjksdfmo94853ff`
