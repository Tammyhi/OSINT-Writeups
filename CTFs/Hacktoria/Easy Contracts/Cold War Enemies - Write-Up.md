# Cold War Enemies
### Objective
The task was to find an air base given a provided image.
The flag was formatted as:  
`country-governate-district-airbasename-air-base`
### Process
I did a reverse Google image search and found many articles with this image. 
From the articles, I discovered this was Russia's Khmeimim air base in Latakia, Syria.
From Wikipedia's entry of the Khmeimim air base, I found that the air base was in the Jableh district, which was the last piece of the flag I needed.
### Flag
The correct flag was: `syria-latakia-jableh-khmeimim-air-base`
